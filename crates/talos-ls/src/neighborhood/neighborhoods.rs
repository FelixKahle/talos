//! Neighborhood abstractions for vessel interaction in local search.
//!
//! This module defines the `Neighborhoods` trait, a high-performance interface for expressing
//! connectivity between vessels in the solver’s search space. Neighborhood relations act as a
//! filter to focus move generation on pairs that can meaningfully interact, reducing wasted work
//! on disjoint or impossible configurations.
//!
//! Implementations expose contiguous slices of neighbors to enable efficient iteration with
//! minimal overhead. Checked and unchecked variants are provided to support hot-loop usage while
//! maintaining clear contracts about bounds safety. The design emphasizes cache locality and
//! predictable access patterns, making it suitable for rejection sampling and other inner-loop
//! heuristics where latency and memory layout are critical.

/// to be unproductive, such as swapping vessels with completely disjoint time windows.

/// to pre-allocated neighborhood data, ensuring $O(1)$ lookup times and high cache locality.
