//! Statistics reporting for local search runs.
//!
//! This module defines a lightweight container for tracking aggregate metrics
//! during a local search, including iteration count, number of candidates found,
//! number of accepted moves, and total elapsed time. The interface is optimized
//! for hot-loop usage: updates rely on saturating arithmetic to avoid overflow
//! traps and expose clear, inline methods for per-iteration and per-event
//! accounting. The resulting `LocalSearchStatistics` can be consumed by monitors,
//! metaheuristics, and result reporting to provide visibility into solver progress
//! and convergence behavior without imposing measurable overhead on the inner loop.
