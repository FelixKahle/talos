//! Interval utilities for closed-open ranges [start, end).
//!
//! This module provides helpers to validate and search collections of
//! disjoint, start-sorted `ClosedOpenInterval<T>` values where `T: PrimInt`.
//!
//! # Provided functions:
//!
//! - `are_disjoint_and_sorted` — checks that intervals are pairwise disjoint and sorted by start.
//! - `lower_bound_start_linear` — O(n) lower bound: first index with `start() >= key`.
//! - `lower_bound_start_binary` — O(log n) lower bound using binary search.
//! - `lower_bound_start` — default lower bound (currently delegates to binary search).
//! - `lower_bound_start_with_threshold` — lets you pick a size threshold to switch between linear/binary.
//!
//! # Semantics
//!
//! Given a slice of intervals sorted by `start()` and pairwise disjoint
//! (i.e., `intervals[i].end() <= intervals[i + 1].start()`), the lower-bound
//! functions return the smallest index `i` such that `intervals[i].start() >= key`,
//! or `intervals.len()` if no such interval exists.
//!
//! # Complexity and performance
//!
//! - Linear search: `O(n)`
//! - Binary search: `O(log n)`
//!
//! Benchmarks (noted in code comments) indicate the binary variant outperforms
//! linear even for very small `n` on modern CPUs, so `lower_bound_start` uses
//! the binary implementation by default.

    //    is dominated by instruction count. Binary search performs O(log N)
    //    comparisons versus O(N), winning immediately.
    // 3. Iterator Overhead: Rust's iterator state machine in linear search
    //    proved slightly more expensive than raw index math even at N=1.
